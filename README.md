# WorkoutGenerator
Code to help organize different exercises into groups and generate a workout. 

First Version: Requires the user to add their workout categories as a key and the workouts as a value pair. For example: the category "Calisthenics" will be the key and workouts like pistol squat, pull-ups, hollow-body hold, etc... are added for that category. Some place holders are currently added to help create categories based on muscle groups.
